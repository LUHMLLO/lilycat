**Lilycat** is a dead simple, props-powered CSS library built for a streamlined, opinionated development experience.  
It keeps your HTML clean and your styling flexible — without drowning you in utility class noise.

Designed for developers who value simplicity and clarity, Lilycat leans heavily on native HTML and vanilla CSS.  
By embracing modern CSS features like variables and layers, it offers a lightweight, scalable foundation that makes extending your UI painless — not a constant battle.

No bloated syntax. No framework lock-in.  
Just clean props, real CSS, and the freedom to build your way.

## 🎯 Mission

Lilycat exists to bring simplicity and freedom back to frontend development.  
We believe great UIs don't require bloated frameworks, endless classes, or custom syntax.

If it can be done with native HTML and CSS, that's the path we choose — tapping into the full power of modern CSS with variables, layers, and cascade control.

Less noise. More signal. True freedom to design, structure, and scale your UI your way.

## 🤌 Why Lilycat?

- **HTML should be clean.**  
  Debugging becomes a nightmare when every element is flooded with utility classes.
  
- **CSS should be a skill, not a chore.**  
  Writing real CSS is powerful — avoiding it shouldn't be the goal.

- **Utility-first should assist, not replace.**  
  Utility classes are great tools — but they're not a replacement for solid CSS fundamentals.

- **Separation of concerns matters.**  
  Styles should live in CSS, not be tangled endlessly into your HTML.

## 📢 Important: Lilycat and Utility Classes

Lilycat is **not** meant to replace Tailwind or other utility-first frameworks.  
In fact, **you can use Tailwind classes alongside Lilycat if you wish.**

While Lilycat encourages cleaner, less polluted HTML, it **does not oppose** utility classes.  
We simply believe that utility-first should be **an assistant, not a crutch.**  
You’re free to mix and match — we trust developers to decide what fits best for each project.
