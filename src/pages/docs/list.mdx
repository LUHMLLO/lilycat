## Definition list <small class="clr-subtext txt-nm txt-lowercase"> native </small>

Description lists in web development are used to group terms and their
corresponding descriptions. The `<dl>` element contains pairs of `<dt>`
(definition term) and `<dd>` (definition description) elements, making it
ideal for displaying lists of terms and their definitions, such as glossaries
or metadata.

## Ordered list <small class="clr-subtext txt-nm txt-lowercase"> native </small>

Ordered lists in web development are used to create lists of items that
are presented in a specific order. The `<ol>` element contains `<li>` (list item)
elements, which are automatically numbered. Ordered lists are ideal for
displaying steps in a process, rankings, or any content where order is
significant.

## Unordered list <small class="clr-subtext txt-nm txt-lowercase"> native </small>

Unordered lists in web development are used to create lists of items that
do not require a specific order. The `<ul>` element contains `<li>` (list item)
elements, which are typically rendered with bullet points. Unordered lists
are ideal for presenting collections of related items where sequence is not
important.
