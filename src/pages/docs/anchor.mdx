## `<a/>` <small class="clr-subtext txt-sm"> (anchor, link) </small>

`<a>` elements in web development create hyperlinks, which are used to
navigate to other pages, sections within a page, or external resources.
They can be styled to look like buttons or other interactive elements,
making them versatile for navigation and linking purposes. Anchors are
essential for creating a connected and interactive web experience.
