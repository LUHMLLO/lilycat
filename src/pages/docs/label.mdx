## `<Label/>` <small class="clr-subtext txt-sm"> (label) </small>

`Label` elements in web development provide a user-friendly way to associate
descriptive text with form controls, such as input elements. By clicking
on a label, users can focus on the corresponding input element, enhancing
accessibility and usability. Labels ensure that forms are easily
understandable and navigable.
